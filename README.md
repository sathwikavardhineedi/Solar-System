# Solar System Simulation

## Description

This project simulates the movement of the Sun, Earth, and Moon in a simplified Solar System model. The simulation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic, animated representation of the Solar System, showing the Earth orbiting around the Sun and the Moon orbiting around the Earth.

## Features

* **Sun, Earth, and Moon Movement**: The Earth revolves around the Sun, and the Moon revolves around the Earth, simulating a realistic orbital system.
* **Animation**: Smooth animations are implemented using CSS and JavaScript to create a continuous motion effect.
* **Interactive**: The simulation runs in real-time, with the Earth and Moon rotating at adjustable speeds.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: For structuring the Solar System model.
* **CSS**: For styling the Sun, Earth, and Moon, as well as animating their movements.
* **JavaScript**: To manage the movement of the Earth and Moon, applying orbital mechanics and controlling the simulation in real-time.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Enjoy watching the Earth and Moon orbiting the Sun!

## Code Overview

* The Sun is placed at the center of the simulation, with the Earth and Moon positioned accordingly.
* Using CSS `@keyframes`, I animated the Earth and Moon to revolve around their respective central bodies.
* JavaScript is used to dynamically adjust the speed of orbits and ensure the Moon always orbits around the Earth.

## Future Enhancements

* Add more planets with their respective moons and orbits.
* Enhance the simulation by adding realistic scaling for distances and orbital speeds.
* Implement interactive controls to adjust the speed of the simulation.
